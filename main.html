                    <p>It really doesn't look like it rn, but I've been putting in some work here. This site has become my passion project lately - it's just so FUN. Every day I pick up a few new things. Then I turn around and the sun has gone down and it's suddenly 2AM, and I've completed MAYBE one page. It is what it is.</p>

                    <p>I'm VERY new to HTML, but I've been poking around with this stuff in my free time lately. I'm slowly doing an overhaul to the visuals on each page, starting with this one. I've added a visitor counter and link to my newly made guestbook. I plan on adding a changelog soon. I'm also trying to make an 'about me' page, among other things. Please bear with me while I figure all of this out. Thanks again for visiting!</p>

                    <p>Welcome to my page! I love the community at Neocities, so I decided to join. Math and science have always interested me, but I never took the plunge into computer science. Lately, I've been teaching myself Python, HTML, and CSS. Accordingly, updates to this site very well may not work correctly or at all. If you have any feedback, please feel free to reach out to me (my contact info is on the bottom of the page).</p>
                    <p>I'm also a bassist and (new) singer, and plan to put my first album together in the next 12 months. I'll be sharing updates as they happen, along with links to demos and finished pieces as they become available.</p>
                    <p>I also have a deep interest in tools that help users maintain their privacy, anonymity, and security. I'll be talking about that a lot in future updates and will have a whole branch of my site dedicated to these topics. I'd like to get into the cybersecurity field one day, but for now I'm just learning the basics. Keep that in mind when I talk about that stuff later on.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for reading and checking out my site.</p>
