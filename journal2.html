            <p>When I said I tried to get into coding years ago, I may not have been clear enough. I got absolutely nowhere fast. Unmedicated and unrecognized ADHD made that near-impossible. Now that I've come back to it, I find I barely remember anything about what I learned before. This website is my 1st real project. It intimidates me that HTML and CSS can sometimes be so difficult for me. I take hours building each of these webpages. Many times during the course of a workday, I'll get intensely frustrated with myself. I try not to let it get to me too bad, and keep pushing on.</p>
            <p>I'm slowly getting the hang of it though, I think. Little by little I level up at this stuff, and I'll be able to move on to learning Javascript in the near future (I hope). I might get frustrated, but MAN this stuff is fun. It just clicks with that part of my brain that spits out dopamine. I should probably learn CSS Grid at some point. I have a lot of brushing up to do on the skills I've been acquiring.</p>
            <p>Things have been ok lately. I've been stressed about some mental health-related stuff, but I think it will pass with time. I've also REALLY been itching to play music again lately, but I haven't had an amp to keep at my apartment in almost a year. My practice amp I used to record and play with at home just died on me on day in May 2023. I took it in for repairs right after, and I haven't seen it since. He's the only guy around me that works on that kind of gear, and he has no idea when the parts he'll need will actually arrive. Fuckin' wonderful. I mean, I still have my nylon string guitar but it just isn't the same as picking up an electric and going to town with it. Plus, my microphones and home acoustics suck for recording. That amp was a nice feature to have around. I'll figure it out...but I gotta get it done faster. Time keeps on tickin'. At least I'm making progress elsewhere for now *shrug*</p>
